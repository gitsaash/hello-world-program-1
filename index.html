            <h2>Metaverse</h2>
            <p>
                In its current meaning, metaverse generally refers to the concept of a highly immersive virtual
                 world where people gather to socialize, play, and work. Awareness of this term surged on
                  October 29, 2021, when Facebook rebranded itself “Meta” and released a video in which CEO
                  <b> Mark Zuckerberg</b> says,<span class="highlight"> “I believe the metaverse is the next chapter for the internet.”</span>

    <h2>Web 3.0</h2>
    <p> <span class="highlight">
    Web 1.0 is the "read-only Web," Web 2.0 is the "participative social Web," and Web 3.0 is the "read, write, 
        execute Web."</span> This Web interaction and utilization stage moves users away from centralized
        platforms like Facebook, Google, or Twitter and towards decentralized, nearly anonymous platforms.</p>

    <h2>Blockchain</h2>
    <p>Blockchain is a system of recording information in a way that makes it difficult or impossible to change,
         hack, or cheat the system. <span class="highlight"> A blockchain is essentially a digital ledger of transactions</span>
         that is duplicated and distributed across the entire network of computer systems on the blockchain.</p>
